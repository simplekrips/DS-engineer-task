Project Overview

- data exploratory.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset. It provides insights into the data's characteristics and preliminary observations.
- train.py: This script trains the model on the training dataset. It then saves two separate files: one for the Polynomial Features model and another for the Linear Regression model.
- predict.py: Uses the model files saved by train.py to make predictions. The predictions are then stored in prediction.csv.
